# CageReact

This repository contains the set of data shown in the paper "Reconstructing Reactivity in Dynamic Host-Guest Systems at Atomistic Resolution: Amide Hydrolysis Under Confinement in a Coordination Cage".

All the input data needed to run the simulations and get the results are organized in 3 different folders:

 * `1.Parametrization/`

	in this folder there are the simulations used to parametrize the modeled systems.
        
 * `2.QM_Simulations/`

	the folder contains the quantum mechanical simulations employed to characterize the reaction. 

 * `3.Simulations/`

	this folder includes the classical MD, WT-MetaD and infrequent WT-Metad simulations for both guest exchanges and guest conformations.
